        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Kobe Nguyen. I am a sophomore at Mt. Eden High School and I am taking computer science. I’ve definitely gained some knowledge on a few languages and applications. Prior to taking this class, I had no knowledge of coding or using any languages. Starting off with C++, I was able to learn concepts like variables, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. On my website, I am displaying some of the projects I’ve created in this class.</p>

      <!-- Project 1 -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Project 1: StopWatch</h3>
        <p>This project was done on CodePen using HTML and JavaScript. It is a simple stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionality. 
          <a href="project1.html">Try the stopwatch!</a></p>

      <!-- Project 2 -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Project 2: Calculator</h3>
        <p>This project is a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It helped me understand how to work with numbers, functions, and user interaction. 
          <a href="project2.html">Check it out!</a></p>

      <!-- Project 3 -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Project 3: Dino Run Game</h3>
        <p>This was my most complex project. Inspired by the Google Dino Run game, I added new features like different backgrounds and characters. 
          <a href="project3.html">Play the game!</a></p>
